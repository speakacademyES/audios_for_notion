cue-3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.720
From the BBC.

cue-4
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.390
Hello, and welcome to Six Minute Grammar
with me, Rob.

cue-5
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.259
-And me, Sophie. Hello.
-Today, we're talking about comparatives

cue-6
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.060
and superlatives, what they are and how to
use them.

cue-7
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.000
Yes, we use comparatives and superlatives
to compare people and things. Listen

cue-8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.760
carefully because, as usual, there is a
quiz at the end of the show.

cue-9
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.699
Okay, we'll start with some examples of
the comparative. So Sophie, um, can you

cue-10
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.880
-stand up please?
-Okay.

cue-11
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.140
-Right. Look, back to back here.
-Okay.

cue-12
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.020
-Now, look, I'm taller than you.
-[laughs] But I'm thinner than you.

cue-13
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.520
Mm, good point. The sentences, "I'm taller
than you," and, "I'm thinner than you,"

cue-14
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.300
-both use the comparative form.
-We use comparatives to compare two people

cue-15
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.780
-or things that are different in some way.
-Listen again to the examples we've just

cue-16
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.780
-used. Where does the word than come?
-I'm taller than you. I'm thinner

cue-17
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.760
-than you.
-Than comes after the comparative

cue-18
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.100
adjective. We usually use than in
comparative sentences.

cue-19
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.660
But not always. For example, I can ask,
"Who is taller? You or me?"

cue-20
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.860
Now, there are different ways to make the
comparative form. For short words, just

cue-21
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.680
add er, that's spelt E-R. So tall becomes
taller.

cue-22
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.220
Thin becomes thinner.

cue-23
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.380
Adjectives like happy, funny, easy, that
end in the sound E spelt with a

cue-24
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.500
Y, add -ier, spelt I-E-R.

cue-25
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.480
-So happy becomes happier.
-Easy becomes easier. An example please,

cue-26
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.920
-Neil.
-English is easier than Chinese.

cue-27
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.160
[laughs] Not if you're Chinese though.
Now, adjectives that have two or more

cue-28
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.100
syllables but don't end in E spelt Y use
more. Neil has some examples.

cue-29
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.360
A tablet is more useful than a laptop. The
film of The Hobbit is more

cue-30
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.440
-exciting than the book.
-Useful has two syllables and exciting has

cue-31
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.760
three, so we say more useful and more
exciting.

cue-32
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.800
-[Music] Six Minute Grammar.
-From the BBC.

cue-33
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.260
And we're talking about comparatives and
superlatives. We've seen how to use and

cue-34
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.320
-make comparatives.
-Now we're going to tell you what

cue-35
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.560
superlatives are and how to use them.
Sophie, are you good at geography?

cue-36
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.000
-Oh, I'll have a go.
-Okay, here's a question for you. What's

cue-37
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.720
-the longest river in the world?
-Well, the Nile is a very long river, but I

cue-38
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.660
think the longest river in the world is
the Amazon?

cue-39
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.500
And you're right, it is the Amazon. The
longest river is a superlative. We use

cue-40
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.780
superlative forms to compare one person or
thing with several others in a group. We

cue-41
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.060
often use them to say which thing or
person is the greatest, the biggest...

cue-42
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.420
-The most beautiful, the best in some way.
-To make the superlative of short words,

cue-43
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.800
like high, deep, tall, add -est. That's
spelt E-S-T.

cue-44
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.440
So the highest mountain, the deepest
ocean, the tallest person.

cue-45
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.180
And remember to put the before the
adjective. So it's, "I'm the tallest

cue-46
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.480
-person in my family."
-Now, for longer adjectives with two or

cue-47
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.840
more syllables, we use most. Rob, who is
the most famous actor in the world?

cue-48
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.600
Oh, well, there are many, aren't there?
But I think, uh, Brad Pitt is the most

cue-49
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.020
-famous actor in the world.
-The most famous actor, so it's the plus

cue-50
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.340
-most plus adjective.
-For adjectives that end in -y, spelt Y,

cue-51
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.240
like funny and happy, we add -iest. That's
I-E-S-T. Here's an

cue-52
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.300
-example.
-The funniest show on TV is The Simpsons.

cue-53
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.680
Now finally, look out for the irregular
comparatives and superlatives.

cue-54
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.800
My iPhone 5 was better than my iPhone 4,
but the iPhone

cue-55
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.840
6 is the best phone on the market now in
my opinion.

cue-56
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.460
The comparative form of good is better,
and the superlative form is best.

cue-57
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.720
-The comparative of bad is worse.
-And the superlative is worst. Listen to

cue-58
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.160
these examples.

cue-59
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.000
Winters have been bad the last few years.
2012 was worse than 2011, but

cue-60
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
2013 was the worst winter since records
began.

cue-61
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.400
Now for the quiz. I'll give you an
adjective and a sentence, and you have to

cue-62
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.980
complete the gap with a comparative or
superlative.

cue-63
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.940
Okay, number one. The word's old. Jenny is
10, and Simon is 15, so Simon

cue-64
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.580
-is than Jenny.
-And the answer is older. Simon is older

cue-65
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.100
-than Jenny.
-Next word, beautiful. The Taj Mahal is the

cue-66
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.360
-building I've ever seen.
-And the answer is most beautiful. The Taj

cue-67
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.840
Mahal is the most beautiful building I've
ever seen.

cue-68
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.400
