From the BBC.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.390
Hello, and welcome to Six Minute Grammar with me, Rob.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.259
And me, Sophie. Hello. Today, we're talking about comparatives and superlatives, what they are and how to use them.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.000
Yes, we use comparatives and superlatives to compare people and things. Listen carefully because, as usual, there is a quiz at the end of the show.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.699
Okay, we'll start with some examples of the comparative. So Sophie, um, can you stand up please?

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.140
Right. Look, back to back here.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.020
Now, look, I'm taller than you. But I'm thinner than you.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.520
Mm, good point. The sentences, I'm taller than you, and, I'm thinner than you, both use the comparative form.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.300
We use comparatives to compare two people or things that are different in some way.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.780
Listen again to the examples we've just used. Where does the word than come?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.780
I'm taller than you. I'm thinner than you.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.760
Than comes after the comparative adjective.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.100
We usually use than in comparative sentences.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.660
But not always. For example, I can ask, Who is taller? You or me?

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.860
Now, there are different ways to make the comparative form. For short words, just add er, that's spelt E-R.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.680
So tall becomes taller.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.220
Thin becomes thinner.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.380
Adjectives like happy, funny, easy, that end in the sound E spelt with a Y, add -ier, spelt I-E-R.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.480
So happy becomes happier. Easy becomes easier. An example please, Neil.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.920
English is easier than Chinese.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.160
Not if you're Chinese though. Now, adjectives that have two or more syllables but don't end in E spelt Y use more.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.100
Neil has some examples.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.360
