-[Music] Six Minute Grammar.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.720
From the BBC.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.390
Hello, and welcome to Six Minute Grammar
with me, Rob.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.259
-And me, Sophie. Hello.
-Today, we're talking about comparatives

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.060
and superlatives, what they are and how to
use them.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.000
Yes, we use comparatives and superlatives
to compare people and things. Listen

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.760
carefully because, as usual, there is a
quiz at the end of the show.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.699
Okay, we'll start with some examples of
the comparative. So Sophie, um, can you

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.880
-stand up please?
-Okay.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.140
-Right. Look, back to back here.
-Okay.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.020
-Now, look, I'm taller than you.
-[laughs] But I'm thinner than you.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.520
Mm, good point. The sentences, "I'm taller
than you," and, "I'm thinner than you,"

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.300
-both use the comparative form.
-We use comparatives to compare two people

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.780
-or things that are different in some way.
-Listen again to the examples we've just

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.780
-used. Where does the word than come?
-I'm taller than you. I'm thinner

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.760
-than you.
-Than comes after the comparative

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.100
adjective. We usually use than in
comparative sentences.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.660
But not always. For example, I can ask,
"Who is taller? You or me?"

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.860
Now, there are different ways to make the
comparative form. For short words, just

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.680
add er, that's spelt E-R. So tall becomes
taller.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.220
Thin becomes thinner.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.380
Adjectives like happy, funny, easy, that
end in the sound E spelt with a

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.500
Y, add -ier, spelt I-E-R.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.480
-So happy becomes happier.
-Easy becomes easier. An example please,
